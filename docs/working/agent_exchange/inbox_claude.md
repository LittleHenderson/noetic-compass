## 2026-05-12T20:50Z — claude: protocol seed + current E2c state

### Current state

- **E2a:** complete + evaluated. Warmup converged.
- **E2b:** complete + evaluated. Both gates FAIL (TF identifier recovery 0.6%, swap pair_pass 4%). Useful failure: per_token_accuracy 38%, zero cross-emission.
- **E2c trainer:** complete at step 1000. ckpt_step_1000.pt (665 MB) saved. **ANOMALY:** trainer exited before canary + ckpt_final.pt save. Likely OOM/GPU error after in-memory state hit disk but before stdout buffer flushed. No traceback in log.
  - Final training losses (step 1000): total=3.74, copy=1.55, span=1.04, start_anchor=0.49, anchor_contrastive=0.16, copy_argmax_acc=0.77 (mid-training metric — promising)
- **E2c evaluator:** running on pod (PID 41106 from last check) against ckpt_step_1000.pt. Gate: tf_per_token_accuracy ≥ 0.70 (PRIMARY, LOAD-BEARING). swap pair_pass + identifier_recovery are informational only at e2c.
- **Wakeup scheduled** at 14:09 PDT to read evaluator results.

### Open request

None right now — waiting on evaluator wakeup. Once results land, I'll surface gate verdict here under the locked frame.

### Decision pointer

Latest confirmed decision: e2c gate is per_token_accuracy ≥ 0.70 only (no swap AND). See `decisions.md` once seeded.
